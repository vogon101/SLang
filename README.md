# SLang
A basic programming language built in scala. It is designed to be easily integrated with existing JVM languages to provide a way to dynamically extend it at runtime. It is not meant to be a full
programming language. It is mostly a learning exercise.

There are two versions. SLang0 is the older, less complete version. It forms the base for the current version 1.0. SLang One is nearing release.

## TODOs
* Add better list construction
* Compile to runnable jar
* Make scripting adapter
  * This will make it easier to use SLang as a scripting module in other projects
  * ie for easy game modding
* Operator overloading
